# Classification-Algorithms-Java-
Implemented kNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes classification algorithms in Java
Evaluated the performance of each algorithm by performing 10 fold cross validation for Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 measure parameters.
Improved the Decision Tree Algorithm by implementing Random forest and then adaptive Boosting using the weighted trees
The project requirements can be found in Project3.pdf and results can be found in Report.pdf
